# LENDING CLUB PROJECT

## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

### Problem Statement
Loan portfolio constitutes the largest operating asset and source of revenue of most commercial banks. However, some of the loans given out become non-performing or end up in default and adversely affect the financial performance of commercial institutions. Research studies have shown that loan defaults limit the institutionsâ€™ financial performance and lending potential.

Loan default can be defined as the inability of a borrower to fulfil his or her loan obligation as at when due (Balogun and Alimi, 1990). As noted by Baku and Smith (1998), the costs of loan delinquencies would be felt by both the lenders and the borrowers. The lender has costs in delinquency situations, including lost interest, opportunity cost of principal, legal fees and related costs. For the borrower, the decision to default is a trade-off between the penalties in lost reputation from default versus the opportunity cost of forgoing investments due to working out the current loan.

Lending Club(in the US) connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back.

Using the data from lending.club.com this study aims to predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
